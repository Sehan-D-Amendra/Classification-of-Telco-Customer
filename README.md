# Classification-of-Telco-Customer

**Overview**: Developed a predictive model to identify telecom customers likely to churn using a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle. The project leverages Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn, and was developed in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

**Key Components**:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized data distributions and analyzed feature correlations with the target variable to uncover insights and guide feature engineering.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created and transformed features to enhance model performance, including scaling numerical features and encoding categorical ones.
- **Model Development**: Implemented a Logistic Regression model using Scikit-learn. Fine-tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score.
- **Insights and Recommendations**: Provided actionable insights for reducing customer churn based on model predictions and feature importance analysis.

**Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook

**Impact**:

- Improved understanding of factors contributing to customer churn.
- Delivered a robust model capable of predicting customer churn, enabling the telecom company to proactively address churn risks and enhance customer retention strategies.
